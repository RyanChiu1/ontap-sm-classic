You can use System Manager to stop a storage virtual machine (SVM) if you want to troubleshoot any issue with the SVM, delete the SVM, or stop data access from the SVM.

== Before you begin

All the clients connected to the SVM must be disconnected.

[NOTE]
====
If any clients are connected to the SVM when you stop it, data loss might occur.

== About this task

* You cannot stop SVMs during storage failover (SFO).
* When you stop the SVM, an SVM administrator cannot log in to the SVM.

== Steps

. Click *Storage* > *SVMs*.
. Select the SVM that you want to stop, and then click *Stop*.

== Results

The SVM stops serving data to clients.
