You can use System Manager to edit the namespace by changing the subsystem that the namespace is mapped to.

== About this task

You can only modify the NVMe subsystem settings in this window, you cannot edit the other namespace details.

== Steps

. Click *NVMe* > *NVMe namespaces*.
. In the *NVMe namespaces window*, select the namespace you want to edit.
. Select a subsystem option:
 ** None: Choosing this option unmaps the existing subsystem mapping for this namespace only. This option is preselected if no subsystem mapping is present for the selected namespace.
 ** Use an existing subsystem: This option is preselected if subsystem-to-namespace mapping is present. Choosing a different subsystem maps the new subsystem by unmapping the previously mapped subsystem.
