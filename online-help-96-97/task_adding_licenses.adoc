If your storage system software was installed at the factory, System Manager automatically adds the software to its list of licenses. If the software was not installed at the factory or if you want to add additional software licenses, you can add the software license by using System Manager.

== Before you begin

The software license code for the specific ONTAP service must be available.

== About this task

* When you add a new license in a MetroCluster configuration, it is a best practice to add the license on the surviving site cluster as well.
* You cannot use System Manager to add the Cloud Volumes ONTAP license.
+
The Cloud Volumes ONTAP license is not listed in the license page. System Manager does not raise any alert about the entitlement risk status of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP license.

* You can upload only capacity-based licenses.
+
The capacity-based licenses are of "`json`" type.

== Steps

. Click *Configuration* > *Cluster* > *Licenses*.
