Opens the CIFS Setup wizard, which enables you to set up CIFS on your storage virtual machine (SVM).

 ** Options
+
Displays the CIFS Options dialog box, which enables you to enable or disable SMB 3.0 signing, to enable or disable SMB 3.0 encryption, and to add Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) servers.

+
You can also reset the information about the discovered servers, add a preferred domain controller, delete a domain controller, or refresh the list of domain controllers.
