You can use System Manager to create SVM relationships to transfer data from the source SVM to the destination SVM. Creating an SVM relationship helps in recovering from a disaster as data is available on the source SVM and on the destination SVM.

== Before you begin

* The destination cluster and source cluster must be running ONTAP 9.5 or later.
* The destination cluster must not be in a MetroCluster configurations.
* Starting with System Manager 9.6, Fabric Pool is supported.

== Steps

. Click *Protection* > *SVM Relationship* > *Create*.
. Select the SVM relationship type from the *SVM Relationship Type* list.
. From the *Source Storage Virtual Machine* pane, select the cluster and the SVM.
. To view SVMs that do not have the required permissions, click *Navigate to the source cluster*, and then provide the required permissions.
. From the *Destination Storage Virtual Machine* pane, specify the name of the SVM that will be created on the destination cluster.
. Select the option to copy the source SVM configuration.
. Click *image:../media/nas_bridge_202_icon_settings_olh_96_97.gif[]*, update the protection policy and protection schedule, select aggregate, and then initialize the protection relationship.
. Click *Save* to create the SVM relationship.
+
The SVM Relationships: Summary window is displayed.

. Click *Done* to complete the process.
