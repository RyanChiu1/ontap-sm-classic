You can use System Manager to disable data transfers to the destination FlexVol volume by quiescing the vault relationship.

== Steps

. Click *Protection* > *Volume Relationships*.
. Select the relationship for which you want to stop the scheduled data transfers, and click *Operations* > *Quiesce*.
. In the *Quiesce* window, click *Quiesce*.

== Results

If there is no transfer in progress, the transfer status is displayed as Quiesced. If a transfer is in progress, the transfer is not affected, and the transfer status is displayed as Quiescing until the transfer is complete.
