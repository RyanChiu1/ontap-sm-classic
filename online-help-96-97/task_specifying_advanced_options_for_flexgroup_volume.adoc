When you create a FlexGroup volume, you can specify options you want to associate with the FlexGroup volume.

.Steps

. In the *Create FlexGroup* window, click image:../media/advanced_options.gif[] to specify the advanced options.
+
The Advanced Options window displays. It contains sections (the headings in the left column), in which you can specify various options.

. In the *General Details* section, select the space reserve and security style, and then set the UNIX permission for the volume.
+
You should note the following limitations:

 ** The Space Reserve option is not available for FabricPool aggregates.
 ** When thin provisioning is enabled, space is allocated to the volume from the aggregate only when data is written to the volume.
 ** For All-Flash Optimized storage systems, thin provisioning is enabled by default, and for other storage systems, thick provisioning is enabled by default.

. In the *Aggregates* section, you can enable the *Select Aggregates* button to override the best practices defaults and select your choices from a list of FabricPool aggregates.
. In the *Optimize Space* section, you can enable deduplication on the volume.
+
System Manager uses the default deduplication schedule. If the specified volume size exceeds the limit that is required for running deduplication, the volume is created and deduplication is not enabled.
+
For systems with All Flash Optimized personality, inline compression and the `auto` deduplication schedule is enabled by default.

. In the *QoS* (Quality of Service) section, specify the policy group to control the input/output (I/O) performance of the FlexGroup volume.
. Click *Apply* to update the changes.
