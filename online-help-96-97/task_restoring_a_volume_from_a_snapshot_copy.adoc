You can use System Manager to restore a volume to a state that is recorded in a previously created Snapshot copy to retrieve lost information. When you restore a volume from a Snapshot copy, the restore operation overwrites the existing volume configuration. Any changes that were made to the data in the volume after the Snapshot copy was created are lost.

* The SnapRestore license must be installed on your system.
* If the FlexVol volume that you want to restore contains a LUN, the LUN must be unmounted or unmapped.
* There must be enough space available for the restored volume.
* Users accessing the volume must be notified that you are going to revert a volume, and that the data from the selected Snapshot copy replaces the current data in the volume.
* If the volume that you restore contains junction points to other volumes, the volumes that are mounted on these junction points will not be restored.
* You cannot restore Snapshot copies for SnapLock Compliance volumes.

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select *All SVMs*.
. Select the volume that you want to restore from a Snapshot copy.
. Click *More Actions* > *Manage Snapshots* > *Restore*.
. Select the appropriate Snapshot copy, and then click *Restore*.
. Select the confirmation check box, and then click *Restore*.
