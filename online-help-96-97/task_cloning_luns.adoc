LUN clones enable you to create multiple readable and writable copies of a LUN. You can use System Manager to create a temporary copy of a LUN for testing or to make a copy of your data available to additional users without providing them access to the production data.

== Before you begin

* You must have installed the FlexClone license on the storage system.
* When space reservation is disabled on a LUN, the volume that contains the LUN must have enough space to accommodate changes to the clone.

== About this task

* When you create a LUN clone, automatic deletion of the LUN clone is enabled by default in System Manager.
+
The LUN clone is deleted when ONTAP triggers automatic deletion to conserve space.

* You cannot clone LUNs that are on SnapLock volumes.

== Steps

. Click *Storage* > *LUNs*.
. In the *LUN Management* tab, select the LUN that you want to clone, and then click *Clone*.
. If you want to change the default name, specify a new name for the LUN clone.
. Click *Clone*.
. Verify that the LUN clone that you created is listed in the *LUNs* window.
