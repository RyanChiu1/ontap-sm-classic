You can use System Manager to enable storage efficiency and to configure both deduplication and data compression or only deduplication on a volume to save storage space. If you have not enabled storage efficiency when you created the volume, you can do so later by editing the volume.

.Before you begin

* The volume must be online.
* If you want to use a policy-based deduplication schedule, you must have created an efficiency policy.

.About this task

* You can enable background compression only if you have enabled background deduplication.
* You can enable inline compression and inline deduplication with or without enabling background compression and background deduplication, respectively.
* You can enable inline deduplication only on volumes that are contained by an aggregate with All Flash Optimized personality and on volumes that are contained by a Flash Pool aggregate.
* Starting with System Manager 9.6, editing storage efficiency is supported for FlexGroup DP volumes.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select *All SVMs*.
. Select the volume for which you want to enable storage efficiency, and then click *Edit*.
. In the *Edit Volume* dialog box, click *Storage Efficiency*.
. Select the *Background Deduplication* check box.
. Select one of the following methods to run deduplication:

 .. Ensure that the *Policy based* option is selected.
 .. Click *Choose*, and then select a storage efficiency policy.
 .. Click *OK*.

Select the *On-demand* option.

. Select the *Background Compression* check box to enable background compression.
+
You cannot enable background compression for a volume that is contained by an aggregate with All Flash Optimized personality.

. Select the *Inline Compression* check box to compress data while it is being written to the volume.
+
By default, inline compression is enabled on volumes that are contained by an aggregate with All Flash Optimized personality.

. Select the *Inline Deduplication* check box to run deduplication before data is written to the disk.
+
By default, inline deduplication is enabled on volumes that are contained by an aggregate with All Flash Optimized personality.

. Click *Save and Close*.
