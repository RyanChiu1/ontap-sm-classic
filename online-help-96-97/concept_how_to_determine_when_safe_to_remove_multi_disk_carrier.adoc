Removing a multi-disk carrier before it is safe to do so can result in one or more RAID groups becoming degraded, or possibly even a storage disruption. System Manager enables you to determine when it is safe to remove a multi-disk carrier.

When a multi-disk carrier has to be replaced, the following events must have occurred before you can remove the carrier safely:

* An AutoSupport message must have been logged indicating that the carrier is ready to be removed.
* An EMS message must have been logged indicating that the carrier is ready to be removed.
* The state of both disks in the carrier must be displayed as `broken` in the Disks window.
+
You must remove the disks only after the carrier mate of a failed disk is evacuated. You can click Details to view the disk evacuation status in the Properties tab of the Disks window.

* The fault LED (amber) on the carrier must be lit continuously indicating that it is ready for removal.
* The activity LED (green) must be turned off indicating there is no disk activity.
* The shelf digital display only shows the shelf ID number.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot reuse the carrier mate of a failed disk. When you remove a multi-disk carrier that contains a failed disk, you must replace it with a new carrier.
