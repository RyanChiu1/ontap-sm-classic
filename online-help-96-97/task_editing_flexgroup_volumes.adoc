Starting with System Manager 9.6, you can edit the properties of an existing FlexGroup volume.

== Before you begin

The FlexGroup volume must be online.

== About this task

FabricPool FlexGroup volumes can be expanded under the following conditions:

* A FabricPool FlexGroup volume can be expanded only with FabricPool aggregates.
* A non-FabricPool FlexGroup volume can be expanded only with non-FabricPool aggregates.
* If the FlexGroup volume contains a mix of FabricPool and non-FabricPool volumes, then the FlexGroup volume can be expanded with both FabricPool and non-FabricPool aggregates.

== Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select *All SVMs*.
. Select the FlexGroup volume that you want to modify, and click *Edit*.
. If you want to rename the FlexGroup volume, enter the new name in the *Name* field.
+
Starting with System Manager 9.6, you can also rename FlexGroup DP volumes.

. Enable the *Encrypted* option to enable encryption for the volume.
+
This option is available only if you have enabled the Volume Encryption license and if the corresponding platform supports encryption.

. Specify the percentage of the Snapshot copy reserve.
. Click image:../media/advanced_options.gif[] to modify the FlexGroup volume settings. Refer to link:task_specifying_advanced_options_for_flexgroup_volume.md#GUID-021C533F-BBA1-41A9-A191-DE223A158B4B[Specifying advanced options for a FlexGroup volume].
. Specify the size to which you want to resize the FlexGroup volume.
+
By default, existing aggregates are used to resize the FlexGroup volume. The minimum size that is allowed for the volume is displayed next to the size fields.
+
