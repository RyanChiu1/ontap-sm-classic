When setting up a basic or enhanced template for a database, server, or virtual desktop, you must provide details to System Manager. After an application is provisioned, you can edit the details and specify a resizing (increased size only). This section describes the fields in each template. Only the fields that are required for provisioning or editing the settings of the specific application are displayed.
