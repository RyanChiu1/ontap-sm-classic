[.lead]
While adding capacity disks (HDDs) to an aggregate, you can change the RAID group to which you want to add the disks by using System Manager.

.About this task

* If the RAID type is RAID-DP, and if you are adding FSAS or MSATA type of disks that are equal to or larger than 10 TB in size, then you can add them only to `Specific RAID group`, and not to `New RAID group` or `All RAID groups`.
+
The disks are added after downsizing the disk size to the size of the existing aggregates.

* If the RAID group is RAID-TEC, and if you are adding FSAS or MSATA type of disks that are equal to or larger than 10 TB in size, then you can add them to `All RAID groups`, `New RAID group`, and `Specific RAID group`.
+
The disks are added after downsizing the disk size to the size of the existing aggregates.

.Steps

. Choose one of the following methods:
 ** Click *Applications & Tiers* > *Storage Tiers*.
 ** Click *Storage* > *Aggregates & Disks* > *Aggregates*.
