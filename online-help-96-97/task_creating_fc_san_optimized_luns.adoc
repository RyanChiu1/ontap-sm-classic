[.lead]
You can use System Manager to create one or more FC SAN optimized LUNs during the initial setup of a cluster on an AFF platform.

.Before you begin

* You must ensure that only one storage virtual machine (SVM) has been created with the name AFF_SAN_DEFAULT_SVM, and that this SVM does not contain any LUNs.
* You must have verified that the hardware setup has been completed successfully.

.About this task

* This method is available only during the initial setup of a cluster with two or more nodes.
+
System Manager uses only the first two nodes to create LUNs.

* Each LUN is created on a separate volume.
* Volumes are thin provisioned.
* Space reservation is disabled on the created LUNs.
* Most of the cluster configurations are already completed at the factory and are optimized for optimum storage efficiency and performance.
+
You must not modify these configurations.

.Steps

. Log in to System Manager by using your cluster administrator credentials.
+
After you create LUNs using this method, you cannot use this method again.
+
If you close the dialog box without creating LUNs, you must navigate to the LUNs tab and click *Create* to access the dialog box again.

. In the *LUN details* area of the *Create LUNs* dialog box, specify the application type:
+
[options="header"]

Oracle

 .. Specify the database name and size.
 .. If you have deployed Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC), then select the *Oracle RAC* check box.
+
Only two RAC nodes are supported. You must ensure that Oracle RAC has a minimum of two initiators added to the initiator group.

 .. Specify the name and size of each LUN.
 .. If you want to create more LUNs, click *Add more LUNs*, and then specify the name and size for each LUN.

|===
Data, log, binary, and temporary LUNs are created based on the selected application type.

. In the *Map to these Initiators* area, perform these steps:
 .. Specify the initiator group name and the type of operating system.
 .. Add the host initiator WWPN by selecting it from the drop-down list or by typing the initiator in the text box.
 .. Add the alias for the initiator.

+
Only one initiator group is created.
. Click *Create*.
+
A summary table is displayed with the LUNs that are created.

. Click *Close*.
