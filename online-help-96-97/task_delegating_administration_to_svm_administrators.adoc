[.lead]
After setting up a functional storage virtual machine (SVM) or SVMs with basic network configuration, you can optionally delegate the administration of the SVM to SVM administrators.

== About this task

SVM administrators cannot use System Manager to manage delegated SVMs. Administrators can manage them only by using the command-line interface (CLI).

== Steps

. In the *Administrator Details* section, set up a password for the `vsadmin` user account.
. If you want a dedicated LIF for SVM management, select *Create a LIF for SVM management*, and then specify the network details.
+
A dedicated SVM management LIF is required for SAN protocols, where data and management protocols cannot share the same LIF. SVM management LIFs can be created only on data ports.

. Specify the network details, including subnet details, for creating iSCSI LIFs:
+
|===
| If you want to...| Then...
a|
Specify the IP address by using a subnet
a|

 .. Select *Using a subnet*.
 .. In the Add Details dialog box, select the subnet from which the IP address must be assigned.
+
For intercluster LIFs, only the subnets that are associated with the selected IPspace are displayed.

 .. If you want to assign a specific IP address to the interface, select *Use a specific IP address*, and then type the IP address.
+
The IP address that you specify is added to the subnet if the IP address is not already present in the subnet range.

 .. Click *OK*.

a|
Specify the IP address manually without using a subnet
a|

 .. Select *Without a subnet*.
 .. In the Add Details dialog box, perform the following steps:
  ... Specify the IP address and the network mask or prefix.
  ... Optional: Specify the gateway.
  ... If you do not want to use the default value for the Destination field, specify a new destination value.
+
If you do not specify a custom value, the Destination field is populated with the default value based on the family of the IP address.

+
If a route does not exist, a new route is automatically created based on the gateway and destination.
 .. Click *OK*.

+
|===

. Specify a port for creating a data LIF:
 .. Click *Browse*.
 .. Select a port from the Select Network Port or Adapter dialog box.
 .. Click *OK*.

== Results

The `vsadmin` account is unlocked and configured with the password.

The default access methods for the `vsadmin` account are ONTAP API `(ontapi)` and SSH `(ssh)`. The SVM administrator can log in to the storage system by using the management IP address.

== What to do next

You must assign aggregates to the SVM by using the Edit Storage Virtual Machine dialog box.

[NOTE]
====
If the SVM does not have any assigned aggregates, the SVM administrator cannot create volumes.
