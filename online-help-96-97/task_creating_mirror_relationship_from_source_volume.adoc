[.lead]
You can use System Manager to create a mirror relationship from the source storage virtual machine (SVM), and to assign a mirror policy and schedule to the mirror relationship. The mirror copy enables quick availability of data if the data on the source volume is corrupted or lost.

.Before you begin

* The SnapMirror license must be enabled on the source cluster and destination cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
-   For some platforms, it is not mandatory for the source cluster to have the SnapMirror license enabled if the destination cluster has the SnapMirror license and Data Protection Optimization \(DPO\) license enabled.
-   After the DPO license is enabled on the destination cluster, you must refresh the browser of the source cluster to enable the `Protect` option.
====

* While mirroring a SnapLock volume, the SnapMirror license must be installed on both the source cluster and destination cluster, and the SnapLock license must be installed on the destination cluster.
* The source cluster and destination cluster and the source SVM and destination SVM must be in a healthy peer relationship.
* The destination aggregate must have space available.
* FlexVol volumes must be online and of type read/write.
* The SnapLock aggregate type must be the same on both clusters.
* A maximum of 25 volumes can be protected in one selection.
* If you are connecting from a cluster running ONTAP 9.2 or earlier to a remote cluster on which Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled, password-based authentication must be enabled on the remote cluster.

.About this task

* System Manager does not support a cascade relationship.
+
For example, a destination volume in a relationship cannot be the source volume in another relationship.

* You can create a mirror relationship between SnapLock volumes of the same type only.
+
For example, if the source volume is a SnapLock Enterprise volume, then the destination volume must also be a SnapLock Enterprise volume.

* If encryption is enabled on the source volume and the destination cluster is running a version of ONTAP software earlier than ONTAP 9.3, then encryption is disabled on the destination volume by default.
* SVMs that are peered only for FlexCache applications and do not have peering permissions for SnapMirror applications are not shown in the list of SVMs in this task. You can use the ONTAP System Manager 9.6 enhanced peering workflow to give permission to, or peer to, these SVMs. You then can select them in this task to create a protection relationship.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select *All SVMs*.
. Select the volumes for which you want to create mirror relationships, and then click *More Actions* > *Protect*.
+
The *Protect* option is available only for a read/write volume.

. Select the *Replication* type:

| If you selected the replication type as...| Do this...
a|
Asynchronous
a|

 .. *Optional:* If you do not know the replication type and relationship type, click *Help me Choose*, specify the values, and then click *Apply*.
 .. Select the relationship type.
+
The relationship type can be mirror, vault, or mirror and vault.

 .. Select a cluster and an SVM.
+
If the selected cluster is running a version of ONTAP software earlier than ONTAP 9.3, then only peered SVMs are listed. If the selected cluster is running ONTAP 9.3 or later, peered SVMs and permitted SVMs are listed.

 .. Modify the volume name suffix, if required.

Synchronous
a|

 .. *Optional:* If you do not know the replication type and relationship type, click *Help me Choose*, specify the values, and then click *Apply*.
 .. Select the synchronization policy.
+
The synchronization policy can be StrictSync or Sync.

 .. Select a cluster and an SVM.
+
If the selected cluster is running a version of ONTAP software earlier than ONTAP 9.3, then only peered SVMs are listed. If the selected cluster is running ONTAP 9.3 or later, peered SVMs and permitted SVMs are listed.

 .. Modify the volume name suffix, if required.

|===

. Click *image:../media/nas_bridge_202_icon_settings_olh_96_97.gif[]*, update the protection policy and protection schedule, select *FabricPool-enabled aggregate*, and then initialize the protection relationship.
. Click *Save*.

.Results

A new destination volume of type _dp_ is created with the following default settings:

* Autogrow is enabled.
* Compression is disabled.
* The language attribute is set to match the language attribute of the source volume.

If the destination FlexVol volume is on a different SVM than the source FlexVol volume, then a peer relationship is created between the two SVMs if the relationship does not already exist.

A mirror relationship is created between the source volume and the destination volume. The base Snapshot copy is transferred to the destination volume if you have opted to initialize the relationship.
