You can use System Manager to modify the volume name for a data protection (DP) volume. If the source volume does not have storage efficiency enabled, you might want to enable storage efficiency only on the destination volume.

== About this task

You cannot modify storage efficiency on a mirror DP volume.

== Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select the storage virtual machine (SVM) in which the DP volume that you want to edit resides.
. Select the volume that you want to modify, and then click *Edit*.
. In the *Edit Data Protection Volume* dialog box, modify the volume name.
. Ensure the *Enable Storage Efficiency* option is selected.
+
If storage efficiency is already enabled on the volume, then the check box is selected by default.

. Click the *Advanced* tab, and perform the following steps:
 .. Select the caching policy that you want to assign to the volume.
 .. Select the retention priority for the cached data in the volume.

+
These options are available only for data protection FlexVol volumes in a Flash Pool aggregate.
. Click *Save*.
