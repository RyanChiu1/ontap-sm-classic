Starting with System Manager 9.6, you can initiate an unplanned switchover of a MetroCluster site. This operation is useful after an outage event or disaster event.

== Before you begin

Your MetroCluster is running in normal operating condition; however, the nodes in the local cluster (Site A) are up, but the nodes in the remote cluster (Site B) are down.

== Steps

. Verify that Site B is actually down.
+
A connection error might make Site B appear to be down.
+
[NOTE]
====
Starting the switchover process with Site B up could cause disastrous results.
====

. In System Manager, log on to the local MetroCluster site (Site A) using the cluster administrator credentials.
. Click *Configuration* > *MetroCluster*
+
TheMetroCluster Switchover/Switchback Operations window displays.

. Click *Next*.
+
The MetroCluster Switchover/Switchback Operations window displays the status of the operations, and System Manager verifies whether a negotiated switchover is feasible.

. When the validation process is complete, click *Switchover Site B to Site A* to initiate the switchover process.
+
A warning message displays, warning you that the switchover operation switches control from Site B to Site A. The status of Site B should be "`UNREACHABLE`", and all Site B nodes are shown in red text.
+
[NOTE]
====
As noted in Step <<STEP_EBC0FFC2349B415AB24156AAAD3F0386,1>>, Site B must actually be down and not just unconnected. Also, you should be aware that the switchover operation might cause data loss.
====

. If you want to proceed, ensure the check box is checked, and then click *Yes*.
+
The switchover process begins. The states of Site A and Site B are displayed above the graphic representations of their configurations. If the switchover operation fails, an error message displays. Click *Close*. Correct any errors and start again at Steplink:task_performing_negotiated_planned_switchover.md#STEP_2BC62367710D4E23B278E2B70B80EB27[1]

. Perform all required maintenance activities for Site B.
. Ensure Site B is up.
+
The healing process begins. When System Manager shows the healing is completed, Site B is operational and the systems prepare for the switchback process. The *Switchback from Site A to Site B* button appears at the bottom of the window.

. Proceed to xref:task_performing_switchback.adoc[Performing a switchback] to initiate the switchback operation.
