You can use System Manager to resize a FlexGroup volume by resizing existing resources or by adding new resources.

== Before you begin

* To resize a FlexGroup volume, there must be enough free space on the existing aggregates.
* To expand a FlexGroup volume, there must be enough free space on the aggregate that you are using for expansion.

== Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select *All SVMs*.
. Select the FlexGroup volume that you want to resize, and then click *More Actions* > *Resize*.
. In the *Resize FlexGroup Volume* window, specify the size to which you want to resize the FlexGroup volume.
+
By default, existing aggregates are used to resize the FlexGroup volume. Starting with System Manager 9.6, the minimum size that is allowed for the volume is displayed next to the size fields.
