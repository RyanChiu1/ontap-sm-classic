[.lead]
You can use System Manager to delete storage virtual machines (SVMs) that you no longer require from the storage system configuration.

== Before you begin

You must have completed the following tasks:

. Disabled the Snapshot copies, data protection (DP) mirrors, and load-sharing (LS) mirrors for all the volumes
+
[NOTE]
====
You must use the command-line interface (CLI) to disable LS mirrors.
====

. Deleted all the igroups that belong to the SVM manually if you are deleting SVMs
. Deleted all the portsets
. Deleted all the volumes in the SVM, including the root volume
. Unmapped the LUNs, taken them offline, and deleted them
. Deleted the CIFS server if you are deleting SVMs
. Deleted any customized user accounts and roles that are associated with the SVM
. Deleted any NVMe subsystems associated with the SVM using the CLI.
. Stopped the SVM

== About this task

When you delete SVMs, the following objects associated with the SVM are also deleted:

* LIFs, LIF failover groups, and LIF routing groups
* Export policies
* Efficiency policies

If you delete SVMs that are configured to use Kerberos, or modify SVMs to use a different Service Principal Name (SPN), the original service principal of the SVM is not automatically deleted or disabled from the Kerberos realm. You must manually delete or disable the principal. You must have the Kerberos realm administrator's user name and password to delete or disable the principal.

If you want to move data from an SVM to another SVM before you delete the first SVM, you can use the SnapMirror technology to do so.

== Steps

. Click *Storage* > *SVMs*.
. Select the SVM that you want to delete, and then click *Delete*.
. Select the confirmation check box, and then click *Delete*.
