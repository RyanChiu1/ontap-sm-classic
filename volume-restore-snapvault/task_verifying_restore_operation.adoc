After performing the restore operation from the SnapVault backup destination volume, you must verify the status of the restore operation on the source cluster.

== About this task

You must perform this task from the *source* cluster.

== Steps

. Navigate to the *Volumes* window.
. Select the source volume in the volumes list and perform one of the following actions, depending on your ONTAP version:
 ** Starting with ONTAP 9.3: Double-click the source volume to view the details, and then click *PROTECTION* to identify the destination volume in the SnapMirror relationship and the name of the SVM that contains the volume.
 ** ONTAP 9.2 or earlier: Click the *Data Protection* bottom tab to identify the destination volume in the SnapMirror relationship and the name of the SVM that contains the volume.
The Type field displays `Restore` temporarily. After the restore operation is completed, the field displays `Vault`.
