You require network addresses and storage configuration information to perform NFS client configuration tasks.

== Target network addresses

You require a subnet with two IP addresses for NFS data LIFs for each node in the cluster. There should be two separate networks for high availability. The specific IP addresses are assigned by ONTAP when you create the LIFs as part of creating the SVM.

If possible, separate network traffic on separate physical networks or on VLANs.

== NFS export information

|===
a|
Export size
a|

a|
Export name (optional)

== information

If you are not using an existing , you require the following information to create a new one:

|===
a|
name
a|

a|
Aggregate for root volume
a|

a|
user name (optional)
