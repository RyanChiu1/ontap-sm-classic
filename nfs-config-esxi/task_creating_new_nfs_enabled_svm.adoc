Setting up a new involves creating the new and enabling NFS. You can then configure NFS access on the ESXi host and verify that NFS is enabled for ESXi by using .

== Before you begin

* Your network must be configured and the relevant physical ports must be connected to the network.
* You must know which of the following networking components the will use:
 ** The node and the specific port on that node where the data logical interface (LIF) will be created
 ** The subnet from which the data LIF's IP address will be provisioned, or optionally the specific IP address you want to assign to the data LIF
* Any external firewalls must be appropriately configured to allow access to network services.

== About this task

You can use a wizard that guides you through the process of creating the , configuring DNS, creating a data LIF, and enabling NFS.

== Steps

. Navigate to the *SVMs* window.
. Click *Create*.
. In the *Storage Virtual Machine (SVM) Setup* window, create the :
 .. Specify a unique name for the .
+
The name must either be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or follow another convention that ensures unique names across a cluster.

 .. Select *NFS* for the data protocol.
+
If you plan to use additional protocols on the same , you should select them even if you do not want to configure them immediately.

 .. Keep the default language setting, C.UTF-8.
+
This language is inherited by the volume that you create later, and a volume's language cannot be changed.

 .. If you enabled the CIFS protocol, change the security style to *UNIX*.
+
Selecting the CIFS protocol sets the security style to NTFS by default.

 .. Select the root aggregate to contain the root volume.
+
The aggregate that you select for the root volume does not determine the location of the data volume.

 .. In the *DNS Configuration* area, ensure that the default DNS search domain and name servers are the ones that you want to use for this .

 .. Click *Submit & Continue*.

+
The is created, but protocols are not yet configured.
. In the *Data LIF Configuration* section of the *Configure CIFS/NFS protocol* page, specify the details of the first data LIF of the first datastore.
 .. Assign an IP address to the LIF automatically from a subnet you specify or manually enter the address.
 .. Click *Browse* and select a node and port that will be associated with the LIF.

+
Do not enter any information to provision a volume. You can provision datastores later using
. Click *Submit & Continue*.
+
The following objects are created:

 ** A data LIF named after the with the suffix "`_nfs_lif1`"
 ** An NFS server

. For all other protocol configuration pages that are displayed, click *Skip*, and then configure the protocol later.
. When the *SVM Administration* page is displayed, configure or defer configuring a separate administrator for this SVM:
 ** Click *Skip*, and then configure an administrator later if required.
 ** Enter the requested information, and then click *Submit & Continue*.
. Review the *Summary* page, record any information that you might require later, and then click *OK*.
+
NFS clients need to know the IP address of the data LIF.

== Results

A new is created with NFS enabled.
