You should periodically monitor the status of the SnapVault relationships to ensure that the data is backed up on the destination volume per the specified schedule.

== About this task

You must perform this task from the *destination* cluster.

== Steps

. Depending on the System Manager version that you are running, perform one of the following steps:
 ** ONTAP 9.4 or earlier: Click *Protection* > *Relationships*.
 ** Starting with ONTAP 9.5: Click *Protection* > *Volume Relationships*.
. Select the SnapVault relationship between the source and the destination volumes, and then verify the status in the *Details* bottom tab.
+
The health status of the SnapVault relationship, any transfer errors, and the lag time are displayed:

 ** The Is Healthy field must display `Yes`.
+
For most data transfer failures, the field displays `No`. In some failure cases, however, the field continues to display `Yes`. You must check the transfer errors in the Details section to ensure that no data transfer failure occurred.

 ** The Relationship State field must display `Snapmirrored`.
 ** The Lag Time must be not more than the transfer schedule interval.
+
For example, if the transfer schedule is daily, then the lag time must not be more than a day.

+
You should troubleshoot any issues in the SnapVault relationships. The troubleshooting procedures for SnapMirror relationships are also applicable to SnapVault relationships.
