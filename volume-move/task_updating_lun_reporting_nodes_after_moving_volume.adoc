If the volume that you moved contained LUNs and the volume is now on a different HA pair, you should remove all remote nodes from the Selective LUN Map (SLM) reporting-nodes list. The LUN map then contains only the owner node and its HA partner, which ensures that only optimized LUN paths are used.

== About this task

This procedure is necessary only if you moved the volume from its HA pair to a different HA pair. If the volume is on a different node of the same HA pair, you can skip this procedure.

== Steps

. Remove all of the remote nodes from the reporting-nodes list by using the `lun mapping remove-reporting-nodes` command with the `-remote-nodes` parameter.

cluster1::> lun mapping remove-reporting-nodes -vserver SVM1 -volume vol1 -igroup ig1 -remote-nodes true

. Verify that the LUN map contains only the owner node and its partner by using the `lun mapping show` command with the `-fields reporting-nodes` parameter.

cluster1::> lun mapping show -vserver SVM1 -volume vol1 -fields reporting-nodes

. Remove stale device entries for the host operating system.
. Rescan from the host to refresh the host's available paths.

See your host documentation for specific steps to rescan your hosts.
