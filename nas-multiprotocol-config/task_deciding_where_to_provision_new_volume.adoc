Before you create a new multiprotocol volume, you must decide whether to place the volume in an existing storage virtual machine (SVM), and, if so, how much configuration the SVM requires. This decision determines your workflow.

== Procedure

* If you want to provision a volume on a new SVM, create a basic SVM.

+
You must choose this option if CIFS and NFS are not already enabled on an existing SVM.

* If you want to provision a volume on an existing SVM that has both CIFS and NFS enabled but not configured, add CIFS and NFS access on the existing SVM.

+
You should choose this option if you created the SVM for SAN access by using the relevant Express Guide.

* If you want to provision a volume on an existing SVM that is fully configured for CIFS and NFS multiprotocol access, you can directly create and configure the volume.
