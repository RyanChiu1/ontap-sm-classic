LUNs on the storage cluster appear to the Linux host as SCSI devices, which are I/O paths that DM-Multipath aggregates into a new device, called a multipath device. The host does not automatically discover new SCSI devices (LUNs) that you add to your system. You must manually rescan them to discover them.

You must have a copy of the `rescan` script, which is in the `sg3_utils` package that is part of your Linux OS distribution.

. Discover new SCSI devices (LUNs) and create the corresponding multipath devices for the LUNs: `/usr/bin/rescan-scsi-bus.sh`
. Verify DM-Multipath configuration:``multipath -ll``

This displays the following type of output, listing the recommended settings for each NetApp LUN:
