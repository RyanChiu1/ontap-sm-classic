DM-Multipath manages multiple paths between the Linux host and the storage cluster. Configuring DM-Multipath on a LUN, which appears to the Linux host as a SCSI device, enables your Linux host to access its LUN on the storage cluster if a path or component fails.

.Before you begin

You must have identified the required version of DM-Multipath from the Interoperability Matrix tool.

https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool]

[NOTE]
====
The recommended approach is that you configure two paths per node into each fabric or Ethernet network. This allows a path to fail without the node switching over to its partner. Using link aggregation (LAG) for the physical ports is not recommended with a Windows-based operating system.
====

.Steps

. Edit the `/etc/multipath.conf` file as follows:
 .. Determine whether there are non-NetApp SCSI devices to exclude (blacklist).
+
These are devices that are not displayed when you enter the `sanlun lun show` command.
+
  *** If there are non-NetApp SCSI devices to exclude, enter the worldwide identifier (WWID) for the devices in the blacklist section of the `multipath.conf` file.
+
To display the WWID of a non-NetApp SCSI device, enter the following command on the device that you want to exclude, where `SCSI_device_name` is a device that you specify: `/lib/udev/scsi_id -gud /dev/SCSI_device_name`
+
For example, if `/dev/sda` is the non-NetApp SCSI device that you want to exclude, you would enter the following: `/lib/udev/scsi_id -gud /dev/sda`
+
This displays the WWID of the device, which you can copy and paste in the `multipath.conf` file.
+
In the following example showing the blacklist section of the `multipath.conf` file, the non-NetApp SCSI device with WWID `3600508e000000000753250f933cc4606` is excluded:
+
----
blacklist {
            **wwid       3600508e000000000753250f933cc4606**
            devnode    "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st)[0-9]*"
            devnode    "^hd[a-z]"
            devnode     "^cciss.*"
}
----

  *** If there are no devices to exclude, remove the _wwid_ line from the `multipath.conf` file.

 .. Enable NetApp recommended DM-Multipath settings by appending the following string to the end of the kernel line in the boot loader: `rdloaddriver=scsi_dh_alua`
. Start the DM-Multipath daemon: `/etc/init.d/multipathd start`
. Add the multipath service to the boot sequence so that the multipath daemon always starts during system boot: `chkconfig multipathd on`
. Reboot the Linux host.
. Verify that the `rdloaddriver` setting appears in the output when you run `cat /proc/cmdline`.
+
The `rdloaddriver` setting appears as one of several boot options that are passed to the kernel:
